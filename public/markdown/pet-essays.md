## A postcard describing an interesting museum you visited
- 一张描述你参观过的有趣博物馆的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Sam,

I'm having a great time in London! Yesterday, I visited the Natural History Museum, and it was absolutely amazing. The building itself is beautiful, but the best part was the dinosaur exhibition. I saw a huge Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton that moved and roared! It was a bit scary but so cool.

They also had a fascinating section about earthquakes, with a simulator that makes you feel like you're in one. I learned so much and took lots of photos to show you. You would love it here.

See you soon,
Alex

- 嗨，山姆，
- 我在伦敦玩得很开心！昨天，我参观了自然历史博物馆，那里真是太棒了。建筑本身就很美，但最精彩的部分是恐龙展览。我看到了一个巨大且会动会吼的霸王龙骨架！有点吓人，但非常酷。
- 他们还有一个关于地震的有趣展区，里面有一个模拟器，让你感觉身临其境。我学到了很多东西，也拍了很多照片给你看。你一定会喜欢这里的。
- 回头见，
- 亚历克斯

## A story about a wish that came true in an unexpected way
- 一个关于愿望以意想不到的方式实现的故事

**正文**：

For my birthday, all I wished for was a puppy. I dreamed of a fluffy golden retriever to play with in the park. My parents said we should wait. One rainy afternoon, I heard a small noise from our garden. I went outside and found a tiny, shivering kitten hiding under a bush. It was all alone.

I brought him inside, wrapped him in a warm blanket, and gave him some milk. My parents agreed we could keep him. I named him Shadow. It wasn't the puppy I wished for, but finding Shadow was even better.

- 生日那天，我唯一的愿望就是想要一只小狗。我梦想着能有一只毛茸茸的金毛寻回犬，可以和它在公园里玩耍。但我的父母说我们应该再等等。一个下雨的午后，我听到花园里传来一阵微弱的声音。我走出去，发现一只浑身湿透、瑟瑟发抖的小猫躲在灌木丛下。它孤零零的。
- 我把它抱进屋，用温暖的毯子裹住它，还喂了它一些牛奶。我的父母同意我们可以收养它。我给他取名叫“影子”。虽然它不是我许愿想要的小狗，但能找到“影子”，我觉得是件更棒的事。
