- 给家人的一张明信片：在新学校的第一周

**正文**：

Hi Mum and Dad,

Greetings from my new school! It's been an amazing first week. Everyone is so friendly, and I've already made a few new friends. My classes are interesting, especially history, and the teachers are really helpful. The campus is huge, with great facilities like a modern library and a fantastic sports hall. I've joined the school's photography club and I'm looking forward to our first meeting next week. I miss you both, but I'm settling in well. Will call you soon!

Love,
[Your Name]

## An article reviewing a movie that all teenagers should watch
- 一篇影评：一部所有青少年都应该看的电影

**正文**：

**"Inside Out": A Must-Watch for Teens**

"Inside Out" is an animated masterpiece that every teenager should experience. This Pixar film brilliantly explores the complex world of emotions inside a young girl's mind. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are personified characters, guiding her through life's challenges. The movie teaches us that all emotions are important, even sadness, and that it's okay to feel them. It's a powerful lesson about mental health and self-acceptance, presented in a fun and engaging way. Watching it can help teenagers understand their own feelings better and empathize with others. Highly recommended!

- **《头脑特工队》：青少年必看**
- 《头脑特工队》是一部动画杰作，每个青少年都应该体验。这部皮克斯电影巧妙地探索了一个小女孩脑海中复杂的情感世界。乐乐、忧忧、怒怒、怕怕和厌厌是拟人化的角色，引导她度过生活的挑战。这部电影告诉我们，所有情绪都很重要，即使是悲伤，感受它们也是可以的。这是一个关于心理健康和自我接纳的有力教训，以一种有趣且引人入胜的方式呈现。观看它可以帮助青少年更好地理解自己的感受，并与他人产生共鸣。强烈推荐！
