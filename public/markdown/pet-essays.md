- 一封邀请你表兄/妹假期来访的邮件

**正文**：

Hi [Cousin's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

The school holidays are coming up next month, and I was thinking it would be great if you could come and stay with me for a few days. We haven't seen each other for ages, and it would be so much fun to catch up!

We could watch all the new movies we've missed, play some video games, and maybe even go hiking on the weekend if the weather is good. My parents said they would be happy to have you here.

Let me know if you think you can make it.

Best,

[Your Name]

- 如果你觉得能来的话，请告诉我。
