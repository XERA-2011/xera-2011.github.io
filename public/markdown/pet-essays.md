**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are things going? I hope you’re doing well.

The holidays are coming soon, and I was wondering if you’d like to come and stay with us for a few days? My parents would be really happy to see you, and so would I! We could do lots of fun things together. We could go cycling in the park, watch some movies, and maybe even visit the new museum downtown. I know you like history!

Please let me know if you can make it. It would be great to catch up properly.

Best,
[Your Name]

- 你好，亚历克斯，
- 近况如何？希望你一切都好。
- 假期很快就要到了，我想知道你是否愿意来我们家住几天？我的父母会很高兴见到你，我也是！我们可以一起做很多有趣的事情。我们可以去公园骑自行车，看电影，也许还可以参观市中心的新博物馆。我知道你喜欢历史！
- 请告诉我你是否能来。能好好叙旧就太好了。
- 此致，
- [你的名字]

## A story about the most important decision you ever made
- 一个关于你做过的最重要的决定的故事

**正文**：

The most important decision I ever made was choosing to study abroad. After finishing high school, I felt unsure about my future. My friends were all staying local for university, and I was tempted to do the same. However, I always dreamed of experiencing another culture. It was a difficult choice because it meant leaving my family and comfort zone behind.

I spent weeks thinking, talking to my parents, and researching. Finally, I decided to apply to a university in Canada. That decision changed everything. I learned a new language, made friends from all over the world, and became much more independent. It was challenging but incredibly rewarding.

- 我做过的最重要的决定是选择出国留学。高中毕业后，我对自己的未来感到不确定。我的朋友们都选择在本地上大学，我也很想这样做。然而，我一直梦想着体验不同的文化。这是一个艰难的选择，因为这意味着要离开我的家人和舒适区。
- 我花了几周时间思考，与父母交谈，并进行研究。最后，我决定申请加拿大的一所大学。那个决定改变了一切。我学会了一门新语言，结交了来自世界各地的朋友，变得更加独立。这很有挑战性，但也非常有意义。
