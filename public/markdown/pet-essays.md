## A postcard from your exchange program abroad
- 一张来自你海外交换项目的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Sarah,

Greetings from London! My exchange program here is absolutely amazing. I'm staying with a lovely host family, and they've been so welcoming. Every day is an adventure! I've already visited the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, and even caught a West End show. The city is bustling, and there's always something new to discover. My English classes are challenging but fun, and I'm making friends from all over the world. I'm learning so much, not just academically, but about different cultures too. Wish you were here! See you soon.

Love,
Emily

- 嗨，莎拉，
- 伦敦问候！我的交换项目真是太棒了。我住在一个很棒的寄宿家庭，他们非常热情。每天都是一次冒险！我已经参观了伦敦塔、白金汉宫，甚至还看了一场西区演出。这座城市熙熙攘攘，总有新事物等待发现。我的英语课很有挑战性但也很有趣，我结交了来自世界各地的朋友。我学到了很多，不仅是学术上的，还有关于不同文化的知识。希望你在这里！很快再见。
- 爱你的，
- 艾米丽

**正文**：

It was a sunny afternoon when Leo saw his friend Mia talking animatedly with a new student, Alex. Leo felt a pang of jealousy; he thought Mia was ignoring him for her new friend. He walked away, feeling hurt. Later, Mia found him looking glum. "Why are you upset?" she asked. Leo confessed his feelings. Mia laughed. "Oh, Leo! Alex was just asking for directions to the library. I was explaining the shortcut!" Leo felt foolish but relieved. They all ended up going for ice cream together, and Leo realized his quick judgment had almost cost him a fun afternoon.

- 那是一个阳光明媚的下午，Leo看到他的朋友Mia正和一个新同学Alex热烈地交谈。Leo感到一阵嫉妒；他以为Mia为了新朋友而忽略了他。他带着受伤的心情走开了。
- 后来，Mia发现他闷闷不乐。“你为什么不高兴？”她问道。Leo坦白了他的感受。Mia笑了。“哦，Leo！Alex只是在问去图书馆的路。我正在给他解释捷径呢！”
- Leo感到很傻，但也松了一口气。他们最后一起去吃了冰淇淋，Leo意识到他仓促的判断差点让他错过了一个愉快的下午。
