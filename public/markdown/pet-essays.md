## An email to your headteacher suggesting a new school club
- 一封给校长的邮件，建议成立一个新的学校社团

**正文**：

Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to suggest a new club for our school: a Coding Club. Many students are interested in technology and learning how to code, but there is currently no club for this.

A Coding Club would be a great way for us to develop useful skills for the future. We could learn programming languages like Python and create our own websites and games. It would also help us with problem-solving and teamwork. We could meet once a week after school in the computer room.

I would be very grateful if you would consider my suggestion.

Yours sincerely,

Alex Chen

- 尊敬的史密斯先生，
- 我写信是想为我们学校建议一个新的社团：编程社团。许多学生对技术和学习如何编程很感兴趣，但目前还没有相关的社团。
- 编程社团将是我们为未来发展实用技能的好方法。我们可以学习像Python这样的编程语言，并创建自己的网站和游戏。这也会帮助我们提升解决问题和团队协作的能力。我们可以每周放学后在电脑室集会一次。
- 如果您能考虑我的建议，我将不胜感激。
- 诚挚的，
- 陈亚历克斯

## An article explaining how students can help protect the environment
- 一篇文章，解释学生如何帮助保护环境

**正文**：

Our planet needs our help, and students can make a big difference! Protecting the environment doesn't have to be difficult. There are many small things we can do every day that add up to a big impact.

Firstly, we can reduce waste by using reusable water bottles and lunch boxes instead of disposable ones. Secondly, saving energy is important. We should always remember to turn off lights and computers when we leave a room. Finally, we can participate in recycling programs at school and at home. By sorting paper, plastic, and glass, we can help save resources.

- 我们的地球需要我们的帮助，而学生们可以发挥重要作用！保护环境不必很困难。我们每天可以做的许多小事，累积起来就会产生巨大的影响。
- 首先，我们可以通过使用可重复使用的水瓶和午餐盒来代替一次性用品，从而减少浪费。其次，节约能源很重要。我们应该时刻记得在离开房间时关掉电灯和电脑。最后，我们可以参与学校和家里的回收计划。通过将纸张、塑料和玻璃分类，我们可以帮助节约资源。
