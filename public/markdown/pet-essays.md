Hi Alex,

I'm having an amazing time here in London! The city is fantastic, and my host family is incredibly kind. I've already visited the British Museum and saw the Tower Bridge, which was absolutely breathtaking. My English is improving a lot because I have to speak it all the time.

Last weekend, my host family took me to a traditional market, and I tried some delicious fish and chips. School is interesting too, and I've made a few new friends from different countries.

Hope you're doing well. See you in a month!

Best wishes,
Chris

- 嗨，亚历克斯，
- 我在伦敦这里过得非常愉快！这座城市太棒了，我的寄宿家庭也极其友善。我已经参观了大英博物馆，还看到了伦敦塔桥，那景色真是令人叹为观止。我的英语进步了很多，因为我必须一直说英语。
- 上周末，我的寄宿家庭带我去了一个传统市场，我品尝了美味的炸鱼薯条。学校也很有趣，我交了几个来自不同国家的新朋友。
- 希望你一切都好。一个月后见！
- 最好的祝愿，
- 克里斯

## An article explaining how students can help protect the environment
- 一篇解释学生如何帮助保护环境的文章

**正文**：

**Our Planet, Our Future**

Protecting the environment is everyone's responsibility, and students can make a big difference. There are many simple things we can do every day at school and at home to help our planet.

Firstly, we should reduce, reuse, and recycle. At school, we can use both sides of our paper and bring reusable water bottles. We should also put plastic, paper, and glass in the correct recycling bins. Secondly, saving energy is very important. Remember to turn off the lights and computers when you leave a room. Small actions like these can save a lot of energy.

By working together, we can create a cleaner and healthier world for the future.

- **我们的地球，我们的未来**
- 保护环境是每个人的责任，而学生们可以发挥重要作用。我们每天在学校和家里都可以做很多简单的事情来帮助我们的地球。
- 首先，我们应该减少使用、重复利用和回收。在学校，我们可以双面使用纸张，并携带可重复使用的水瓶。我们也应该将塑料、纸张和玻璃放入正确的回收箱。其次，节约能源非常重要。记住在离开房间时关掉电灯和电脑。像这样的小行动可以节省大量能源。
- 通过共同努力，我们可以为未来创造一个更清洁、更健康的世界。
