Hi [Friend's Name],

How are things going? I hope you're doing well. I wanted to tell you about this amazing new restaurant I tried last weekend called "The Green Plate." It's a vegetarian place downtown, and the food was absolutely delicious! I had their special falafel wrap, and it was fresh and full of flavour. The atmosphere was also very cozy and modern, perfect for a relaxed dinner. Prices are quite reasonable too. You know how much we love trying new spots, so I really think you should check it out. Let's go together soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
