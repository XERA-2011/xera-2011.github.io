## An email to a gym asking about membership fees and facilities
- 给健身房写一封邮件，咨询会员费用和设施情况

**正文**：

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to inquire about membership options at your gym. I live near your facility and am interested in joining.

Could you please provide details about your monthly and annual membership fees? I would also like to know if there are any special discounts for students. Furthermore, I am curious about the facilities you offer. Do you have a swimming pool and offer group classes, such as yoga or spinning? If so, are these included in the standard membership fee?

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Chris Wang

- 尊敬的先生或女士：
- 我写信是为了咨询贵健身房的会员选项。我住在健身房附近，有兴趣加入。
- 您能否提供关于月度和年度会员费用的详细信息？我还想知道是否有针对学生的特殊折扣。此外，我对你们提供的设施很好奇。请问你们有游泳池吗？是否提供瑜伽或动感单车等团体课程？如果有，这些项目是否包含在标准会员费中？
- 期待您的尽快回复。
- 此致，
- Chris Wang

## Write a story about an unexpected message you received
- 写一个关于你收到的意外消息的故事

**正文**：

Last Saturday, I was relaxing at home when my phone buzzed. It was a message from an unknown number. "Hi, is this Alex? I found your old sketchbook from high school in a box of used books I bought." I was shocked. I had lost that sketchbook years ago and thought it was gone forever. It contained all my favourite drawings.

I quickly replied, and we arranged to meet at a local café. The person, a friendly student named Leo, returned my sketchbook. I was so grateful that I bought him a coffee and we chatted for an hour about art and school. It felt amazing to have a piece of my past returned to me so unexpectedly.

- 上周六，我正在家休息，手机突然响了一声。是一条来自未知号码的消息：“你好，请问是Alex吗？我在我买的一箱旧书里，找到了你高中的素描本。”我当时惊呆了。那本素描本我多年前就丢了，以为再也找不回来了。里面全是我最喜欢的画。
- 我赶紧回复，我们约在一家本地咖啡馆见面。对方是一位友好的学生，名叫Leo，他把素描本还给了我。我非常感激，请他喝了杯咖啡，我们聊了一个小时关于艺术和学校的事情。能如此意外地找回一段属于我过去的回忆，感觉真是太棒了。
