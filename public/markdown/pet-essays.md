## An email to a friend recommending a new restaurant you tried
- [给朋友写一封电子邮件，推荐你尝试过的一家新餐厅]

**正文**：

Hi Alex,

How are you? I'm writing to tell you about an amazing new Italian restaurant I tried last weekend called "La Trattoria." You would love it!

The restaurant has a really cozy atmosphere, and the staff are incredibly friendly. I ordered the seafood pasta, and it was absolutely delicious – probably the best I've ever had. They also have a great selection of pizzas and desserts. The prices were quite reasonable, too.

We should definitely go there together sometime soon. Let me know when you're free!

Best,
Chris

- 你好，亚历克斯，

- 餐厅的氛围非常舒适，员工也极其友好。我点了海鲜意面，味道简直太棒了——可能是我吃过最美味的。他们还有很多很棒的披萨和甜点可供选择。价格也相当合理。
- 我们近期一定要找个时间一起去。有空的时候告诉我！
- 祝好，
- 克里斯
