- 描述你参观的一个有趣博物馆的明信片

**正文**：

Hi Sarah,

Greetings from London! I'm having a fantastic time here. Yesterday, I visited the British Museum, and it was absolutely incredible. It's so huge, and there are countless amazing things to see. My favourite part was the Egyptian mummies – they were fascinating and a little bit spooky! I spent hours just looking at all the ancient artifacts. The Rosetta Stone was also very impressive. I wish you were here to see it with me. We should plan a trip together soon!

Best,
Xiao Ming

- 嗨，莎拉，
- 伦敦问候！我在这里玩得很开心。昨天，我参观了大英博物馆，它简直令人难以置信。它太大了，有无数令人惊叹的东西可看。
- 我最喜欢的部分是埃及木乃伊——它们既迷人又有点吓人！我花了几个小时只是看所有古代文物。罗塞塔石碑也给我留下了深刻的印象。
- 我希望你在这里和我一起看。我们应该尽快一起计划一次旅行！
- 最好的，
- 小明

## A story about helping a stranger
- 一个关于帮助陌生人的故事

**正文**：

It was a rainy afternoon, and I was hurrying home when I saw an elderly woman struggling with her groceries. Her bag had broken, and apples were rolling onto the wet pavement. Without thinking, I stopped to help. I quickly gathered the scattered items and offered to carry her remaining bags to her flat, which was just around the corner. She thanked me warmly, and her smile brightened the gloomy day. It felt good to know I had made her day a little easier. Sometimes, a small act of kindness can make a big difference.

- 那是一个下雨的下午，我正匆匆赶回家，看到一位老妇人正费力地提着她的杂货。她的袋子破了，苹果滚到了湿漉漉的人行道上。
- 我没多想，就停下来帮忙。我迅速捡起了散落的物品，并提出帮她把剩下的袋子提回家，她家就在拐角处。
- 她热情地感谢了我，她的笑容点亮了阴沉的一天。知道我让她的日子轻松了一点，感觉很好。有时，一个小小的善举就能带来很大的不同。
